Demo on Under 13 / Phone & Email Validation

1. Introduction

Hi Everyone, today I will be giving a demo on the Under 13 / Phone & Email Validation story.

In the last sprint, we already provided a demo for the Under 13 functionality.

Today, I will be presenting the full flow, including phone and email validation.



2. Feature Switch Flags

We have introduced separate feature switch flags for Under 13 and Phone/Email Validation.

I will demonstrate the functionality with the flags turned on and off for both features.



3. Under 13 Validation

I will demonstrate the flow with a user whose age is below 13.

Here, I will enable the Under 13 feature flag.

After entering all details and clicking Next, the system navigates to a newly created error page.

In the backend, we validate the user’s age, and if the age is under 13, we return a new error code specific to this feature.



4. Phone & Email Validation

First, we validate the Under 13 condition.

If the user's age is above 13, the system then validates email and phone (only if the Phone/Email feature flag is enabled).

If the flag is disabled, the system skips phone/email validation and moves to the next step.



5. Feature Flag Behavior

If the Under 13 feature switch flag is disabled, the system directly validates phone/email if the Phone/Email flag is enabled.

Otherwise, it follows the normal flow.

If both feature flags are disabled, it does not affect the normal flow, and the system works as usual.



6. Error Handling

If the user enters an incorrect email or phone number, the system validates both fields.

If either phone or email is incorrect, an "Unable to proceed" error message immediately appears on the screen.



7. Null Checks & Logging

If the BankPro call returns null results, we log the issue and display a generic error message on the page.

If the Date of Birth (DOB) is null, empty, or in an incorrect format, a generic error message is displayed.

If the phone or email is null or empty, a generic error message is also shown.

### **Above 13 Flow**
6. **Scenario**:  
   - User age is **above 13**.  

7. **Steps**:  
   - System proceeds to validate **email and phone** (if Phone/Email feature flag is enabled).  
   - If Phone/Email flag is **disabled**, system skips validation and moves to the next step.
