Angular
We’re still facing access issues that prevent us from running the OLB application locally. As a workaround, I continued development and tested the changes directly in the Q5 environment, though this approach requires significantly more effort.

Here’s what I’ve completed:

Developed the fraud prevention pop-up.

Ensured it displays only once per session.

Fetched and integrated CMS content into the pop-up.

Added a feature flag to control its visibility.

The only pending task is adjusting the design—the pop-up is currently appearing inside a lightbox and needs to be repositioned.
