Angular
Good morning everyone,

Today, I will demo the story related to the "Lost/Stolen Page Refresh" functionality.

Scenario:
User logs in to the Online Banking (OLB) portal.

Navigates to the Card Management section.

Initiates the "Report Lost/Stolen" process for a card.

On the lost/stolen page, there are two buttons: Cancel and Submit.

Existing Behavior:
When the user clicks Cancel, the application navigates back to the previous page, and the data is refreshed properly.

When the user clicks Submit, the process completes successfully, and the user is taken to a Success page.

On the Success page, there's a link: "Report another card lost or stolen."

However, when the user clicks this link:

The page does not load the latest card data.

The user needs to manually refresh the page to see updated information.

Fix Implemented:
I have implemented a solution where:

When the user clicks the "Report another card lost or stolen" link,

The page is automatically refreshed, and

The latest card data is displayed to the user without needing manual refresh.
