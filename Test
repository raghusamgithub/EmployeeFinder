Angular
Acceptance Criteria for Popups on ACH/Wire Screen
First Popup (One-Time Display)

When the user lands on the ACH or Wire screen for the first time, the first popup should appear immediately.

This popup should only be shown once per login session.

If the user navigates to another screen and returns, the first popup should not reappear.

The user can close the popup by either:

Clicking the "X" (close icon).

Clicking the "Continue" button inside the popup.

Second Popup (Always Displayed on Continue)

The second popup should always appear when the user clicks the "Continue" button on the landing page.

Before displaying this popup, all required fields on the page must be validated.

This popup should appear before navigating to the next screen (e.g., the confirmation page).
