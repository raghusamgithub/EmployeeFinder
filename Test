## Status Update: Transfer Limits v3 (for Scrum Master & Client)

- Completed code changes for Transfer Limits v3.  
- Last sprint: Tested Checking, Savings, and Visa accounts — passed.  
- Current sprint: Implemented Mortgage Loan and Installment Loan changes; tests passed through Monday.  
- Blocker yesterday: Installment Loan testing failed due to host issue while DPAPI was running release tests on a different branch.  
- Resolution: Requested DPAPI support on Tuesday; today they reverted to the old branch and deployed to QA — Installment Loan testing passed.  
- New issue: Checking/Savings display balance shows 0 due to a host-side problem; DPAPI is working on a fix.  
- Impact: Today’s testing for Checking/Savings is affected by the host issue (these worked last sprint).  
- Coverage: ~80% of code changes verified across multiple account types.  
- Next steps: Recommend full UI-based regression across all account types; will address any account-specific issues discovered.


Got it — you want to update the earlier status point to reflect the correct detail that the DPAPI team **reverted to the old branch** before deploying to QA.  

Here’s the revised status update with that correction:  

***

**# Status Update: Transferimits v3  

- Completed all code changes for Transfer Limits v3.  
- In the last sprint, tested with selected account types: Checking, Savings, and Visa — tests passed.  
- In the current sprint, implemented changes for Mortgage Loan and Installment Loan; user testing was successful through Monday.  
- Yesterday, Installment Loan testing was blocked due to a host issue; the DPAPI team confirmed they were running release testing on a different branch.  
- Requested DPAPI support on Tuesday; today they reverted to the old branch, deployed to QA, and Installment Loan testing then passed.  
- Identified a separate issue for Checking and Savings accounts: display balance returning zero due to a host-side problem; DPAPI team is actively working on a fix.  
- Although these accounts worked in the last sprint, today’s testing for Checking and Savings is impacted by the host issue.  
- Approximately 80% of code changes are verified and working across multiple account types; recommend comprehensive UI-based testing across all account types, and we will address any account-specific issues as they arise.

Do you want me to also rephrase this update into a **crisper, bullet-point format** specifically for a Scrum Master and client email?


Here’s a cleaner, more professional rewrite of your update in bullet points so it’s clear for your client and Scrum Master:

---

**Update for Transfer Limits Story**

1. Completed code changes for **Transfer Limits V3**.
2. **Last sprint** – Tested successfully with a few account types: *Checking Account*, *Savings Account*, and *Visa Account*.
3. **This sprint** – Added code changes for *Mortgage Loan* and *Installment Loan* account types. Testing was successful until Monday.
4. **Yesterday** – Faced an issue testing *Installment Loan* accounts due to a **host-side problem**. Discussed with the DPAPI team, who confirmed they were doing release testing and had deployed a different branch.
5. I had requested them on Tuesday to deploy the correct branch. They completed it today, and I successfully tested *Installment Loan* accounts – **working fine now**.
6. Found another issue for *Checking* and *Savings* account types where the display balance was coming as zero (host issue). DPAPI team confirmed they are working on fixing it.
7. Even though these accounts worked last sprint, we are currently blocked from testing them due to the host issue.
8. **Current status** – Around **80% of my code changes are tested and working** with multiple account types.
9. **Recommendation** – In future, we should test thoroughly with all account types from the UI. If any account-specific issues arise, I will make the necessary code changes accordingly.

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, crisp status version** for quick daily standup updates. That would make it even easier for your Scrum Master and client to read in a few seconds.
Here’s the **short and crisp version** for a daily standup or quick client update:

---

* Host issues affecting *Checking* & *Savings* testing (balance showing as zero) – DPAPI team working on fix.
* **80% changes tested & working**; will test remaining account types once host issues are resolved.

If you want, I can also make a **polished email format** for sending this to your client so it looks formal and professional. That way it works both in standup and email.
