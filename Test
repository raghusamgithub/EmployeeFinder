### **Update on Transfer Limits Integration in EAPI**

I have completed the coding changes related to the integration of transfer limits in the EAPI module:

1. **Upgraded to DPAPI V3**: The system is now consuming version V3 of the DPAPI, replacing the earlier V2 integration.
2. **Change in Data Source**:

   * **V2**: All transfer limit data was provided directly by the Host.
   * **V3**: Only static fields such as maximum/minimum transfer limits (both "From" and "To") are retrieved from the database based on the account type.
3. **Cache-Based Lookup**: In V3, all limit details are fetched from the cache depending on the account type and subtype, rather than from the Host.

The integration and testing of most account types have been completed successfully in the Q5 environment.

However, a few account types are pending due to test data issues on the Host side. Raj has raised a ticket for these issues, and the Host team is currently working on resolving them.

Once the required data is available, I will proceed with the remaining development and testing for those specific account types.

At this stage, the V3 integration in EAPI is **partially blocked** due to the above dependency.
