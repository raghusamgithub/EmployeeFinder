Angular
ased on the provided details, here’s a breakdown of the story point estimation:

Approach 1: REST API-based Obfuscation
Estimated at 5 story points per event.

Each event needs to be individually integrated with the API.

Might require API security, latency checks, and additional handling for different consumers.

Total estimation: (9 + 12) * 5 = 105 story points (which seems too high).

Approach 2: .DLL-based Obfuscation
Requires significant initial effort to implement within the shared project.

The first 2 events will take higher effort, estimated at ~8-13 story points (including foundational changes).

Subsequent events will have lower effort, likely 2-3 story points per event.

Estimated breakdown:

First 2 events: ~13 story points.

Remaining 19 events: ~2-3 points per event → (19 * 3) = 57 story points.

Total for .DLL approach: ~70 story points (approx.).

Final Recommendation:
If time is a constraint → REST API approach could be considered for quick implementation.

If long-term reusability is a priority → .DLL approach is more maintainable across OLB and E-Manager, though it requires a higher initial effort.

Given that you mentioned the DLL approach would be easier to use across both applications, the DLL approach seems preferable, but requires buy-in for the upfront effort.

Would you like to break this into multiple stories/phases for better tracking?

Here’s how we can break down the PRM to Kafka Obfuscation into multiple stories/phases for better tracking:

Phase 1: Foundation Setup (High Effort)
Story 1: Implement Obfuscation/Deobfuscation Utility in DLL (13 points)

Develop a shared module for obfuscating and deobfuscating IBN.

Ensure it is reusable across both OLB and E-Manager.

Write unit tests for validation.

Story 2: Integrate DLL with Kafka Producer for OLB (First Event) (8 points)

Modify OLB’s Kafka producer to use the new obfuscation logic for the first event.

Validate data flow and debugging.

Story 3: Integrate DLL with Kafka Producer for E-Manager (First Event) (8 points)

Modify E-Manager’s Kafka producer similarly.

Ensure compatibility with existing consumers.

Phase 2: Rollout to Remaining Events (Medium Effort)
Story 4: Apply Obfuscation for 5 More Events in OLB (15 points)

Batch processing to reduce overhead.

Story 5: Apply Obfuscation for 5 More Events in E-Manager (15 points)

Similar batch processing as OLB.

Story 6: Complete OLB Implementation (Final 6 Events) (18 points)

Finish remaining events, perform regression testing.

Story 7: Complete E-Manager Implementation (Final 4 Events) (12 points)

Ensure all events are handled.

Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Low Effort)
Story 8: Integration Testing with Consumers (5 points)

Validate that Kafka consumers can deobfuscate data properly.

Story 9: Performance & Security Testing (5 points)

Ensure encryption speed and application impact are minimal.

Total Estimated Points: ~79 points
This breakdown allows gradual implementation, reducing risk while ensuring progress visibility. Let me know if you’d like to refine further!

Dependency from the subscribe ready to accept the encrypted data
ChatGPT said:
Since the Kafka consumer (subscriber) must be ready to accept and deobfuscate the encrypted data, we need to account for the dependency in our estimation and phasing. Here's how we can adjust the breakdown:

Phase 1: Foundation Setup & Consumer Readiness (High Effort)
Story 1: Implement Obfuscation/Deobfuscation Utility in DLL (13 points)

Develop shared obfuscation logic.

Write unit tests for encryption & decryption.

Story 2: Modify Kafka Consumer to Support Deobfuscation (8 points)

Ensure consumers can decrypt obfuscated IBN before processing.

Validate with a test event before producer integration.

Phase 2: Producer Implementation (Only After Consumer is Ready)
Story 3: Integrate DLL with Kafka Producer for OLB (First Event) (8 points)

Modify Kafka producer to use obfuscation logic.

Story 4: Integrate DLL with Kafka Producer for E-Manager (First Event) (8 points)

Phase 3: Batch Processing of Remaining Events (Medium Effort)
Story 5: Apply Obfuscation for 5 More Events in OLB (15 points)

Story 6: Apply Obfuscation for 5 More Events in E-Manager (15 points)

Story 7: Complete OLB Implementation (Final 6 Events) (18 points)

Story 8: Complete E-Manager Implementation (Final 4 Events) (12 points)

Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Low Effort)
Story 9: Integration Testing with Kafka Subscribers (5 points)

Verify end-to-end encryption & decryption flow.

Story 10: Performance & Security Testing (5 points)

Total Estimated Points: 92 points
This revised breakdown ensures we first enable the subscriber (consumer) to accept obfuscated data before rolling out the producer changes. Let me know if you’d like further refinements!

Create 4 story

Here are four well-defined stories for the PRM to Kafka Obfuscation implementation:

Story 1: Implement Obfuscation/Deobfuscation Utility in DLL
Description:
Develop a shared obfuscation and deobfuscation module inside the shared project to ensure secure handling of IBN across Kafka streams. This module should be reusable across both OLB and E-Manager applications.

Acceptance Criteria:

Create a DLL with obfuscation and deobfuscation logic.

Ensure the module is easily accessible in both OLB and E-Manager.

Implement unit tests to verify encryption and decryption accuracy.

Estimate: 13 Story Points

Story 2: Modify Kafka Consumer to Support Deobfuscation
Description:
Ensure that Kafka subscribers (consumers) can correctly decrypt the obfuscated IBN received from the producer before processing.

Acceptance Criteria:

Update all Kafka consumers to call the deobfuscation method.

Validate successful decryption for different test cases.

Ensure no impact on existing message processing.

Estimate: 8 Story Points

Story 3: Integrate DLL with Kafka Producer for OLB (First Event)
Description:
Modify the Kafka producer in OLB to use the newly created obfuscation module when sending IBN data to Kafka. This implementation will serve as a pilot for further event integration.

Acceptance Criteria:

Modify one Kafka producer event in OLB to obfuscate IBN before publishing.

Validate that the Kafka message contains obfuscated data.

Ensure the consumer can successfully decrypt the message.

Estimate: 8 Story Points

Story 4: Integrate DLL with Kafka Producer for E-Manager (First Event)
Description:
Modify the Kafka producer in E-Manager to use the obfuscation module for sending IBN to Kafka. This event will serve as the baseline for further integration in E-Manager.

Acceptance Criteria:

Modify one Kafka producer event in E-Manager to obfuscate IBN before publishing.

Validate that the Kafka message contains obfuscated data.

Ensure the consumer can successfully decrypt the message.

Estimate: 8 Story Points
