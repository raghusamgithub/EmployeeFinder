Angular
Given the request to estimate a feature and break it down into stories and tasks with points, here's a breakdown of the "Address Change Block after Debit/NOW Card Order" feature.
Feature Name: Address Change Block after Debit/NOW Card Order
Feature Description: To prevent fraudulent address changes immediately after a debit or NOW card is ordered (due to lost/stolen replacement, damaged replacement, or new card issuance), the ability for a customer to change their mailing address in Online Banking (OLB) will be blocked for 24 hours. An error message will be displayed to the customer during this period.
Business Value: Reduces risk of fraud, enhances security for customers, protects the bank from potential losses.
Breakdown into Stories:
Story 1: Implement 24-Hour Address Change Block for Card Orders
 * Description: As a customer, when I have ordered a new, replacement, or lost/stolen debit/NOW card within the last 24 hours, I should be prevented from changing my mailing address in OLB and see an informative message, so that fraudulent address changes are prevented.
 * Acceptance Criteria:
   * When a debit/NOW card order (lost/stolen, replacement, add new checkcard) has been initiated within the last 24 hours for the customer's account, navigating to the "Change Mailing Address" page in OLB displays an error message.
   * The error message displayed is: "This function is not available at this time. Please check back later or visit a local branch for assistance." (Note: Awaiting XD content approval, but this is the current placeholder).
   * The address change functionality (e.g., input fields, save button) is disabled or not rendered on the page when the block is active.
   * The check for recent card orders is performed using the "card hub retrieve cards call" to get the card requested date.
   * The block is lifted automatically after 24 hours from the card order initiation time.
 * Points Estimate: 8 (Medium-High complexity due to integration, error handling, and timing considerations)
Story 2: Display Error Message for Address Change Block
 * Description: As a customer, when my address change is blocked due to a recent card order, I should see a clear and concise error message, so that I understand why I cannot proceed.
 * Acceptance Criteria:
   * The approved error message ("This function is not available at this time. Please check back later or visit a local branch for assistance.") is displayed prominently on the "Change Mailing Address" page when the block is active.
   * The error message is styled appropriately to stand out.
   * The user is unable to proceed with an address change while the message is displayed.
   * The error message is localized if OLB supports multiple languages.
 * Points Estimate: 3 (Relatively straightforward UI work, dependent on Story 1 for triggering the display)
Story 3: Backend API Integration for Card Order Validation
 * Description: As the OLB system, I need to reliably communicate with the Card Hub via EAPI to retrieve recent card order information, so that I can determine whether an address change block is required.
 * Acceptance Criteria:
   * Successful integration with the Card Hub "retrieve cards call" EAPI.
   * The EAPI call returns the card requested date for all relevant cards associated with the customer's account.
   * Error handling for EAPI call failures (e.g., timeouts, network issues) is implemented gracefully, potentially falling back to a "safe" (blocked) state or displaying a generic error.
   * The system can correctly identify if any relevant card has been ordered within the last 24 hours based on the card requested date.
 * Points Estimate: 5 (Involves API integration, data parsing, and error handling)

   * 2.1 (2) + 2.2 (1) + 2.3 (1) = 4 points
   * 3.1 (3) + 3.2 (4) + 3.3 (3) = 10 points
   * Total Tasks Points: 25 + 4 + 10 = 39 points
Reconciliation of Story Points vs. Task Points:
It's common for the sum of task points to be higher than the story points. Story points are a high-level estimate of complexity, uncertainty, and effort for the entire story, often reflecting the "unknowns" at the story level. Task points are more granular estimates of known work. The discrepancy indicates that while the high-level story might seem like a certain size, the detailed breakdown reveals more specific, smaller pieces of work.
The story point estimates (8, 3, 5) seem reasonable for the complexity involved. The sum of task points (39) reflects the detailed work, including testing, documentation, and specific technical implementations. This suggests that the feature, while conceptually simple, has a good number of moving parts and dependencies.
Important Considerations and Potential Technical Debt:
 * "not approved XD content needed": This is a critical dependency. The UI implementation of the error message relies on final approval. This should be a clear blocker for final UI sign-off.
 * RCIF to Temenos Migration: The note "there will be technical debt once RCIF moves to temenos" is very important. This implies that the current solution, while functional, might require significant re-work or re-integration once the core system changes. This should be explicitly flagged in any architectural or long-term planning discussions. It might be worth a separate "Technical Debt" story for future refactoring.
 * "Removing Reggie from scope": Good clarification, but note that future address change functionality in Reggie will need to consider this blocking parameter.
 * Performance: The "card hub retrieve cards call" needs to be performant, as it will be called every time a user lands on the mailing address page. Caching strategies might be considered if performance becomes an issue.
 * Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like multiple debit cards, joint accounts, cards ordered by different account holders, etc. Ensure the "retrieve cards call" handles these scenarios correctly and the logic considers all relevant cards.
 * Time Zones: Ensure consistent handling of timestamps and the 24-hour window across different systems and time zones.
 * Test Data: Generating appropriate test data for the 24-hour window (cards ordered at specific times) will be crucial for effective testing.
