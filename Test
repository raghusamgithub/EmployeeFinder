Fraud Prevention Popup Behavior

When a user logs into OLB (Online Banking) for the first time and clicks on either the ACH or Wire link in the ACH and Wire Transfer landing page, a fraud prevention popup should be displayed once per session.

If the user navigates to another page and returns to the ACH or Wire page within the same session, the popup should not appear again.

If the user logs out and logs in again, then navigates to the ACH or Wire page, the popup should be displayed again.

If the fraud prevention flag is turned OFF, the popup should not be displayed at all.

If the flag is ON, the popup should be displayed as per the session rules above.
