Acceptance Criteria for DPAPI Endpoint Integration and EAPI Alignment

1. Review and Compare Endpoints:

Go through the new version of the DPAPI endpoint.

Compare it thoroughly with the previous response structure.

Identify all changes in request and response properties.



2. EAPI Adjustments:

Update the EAPI request and response models to align with the new DPAPI structure.

Ensure backward compatibility, if applicable, or flag breaking changes.



3. OLB (Online Banking) Side Analysis:

Review existing OLB functionality and integration with DPAPI.

Identify which fields from the old DPAPI are:

Still in use

No longer used

Missing in the new version


Document each field with appropriate tags: Used / Not Used / Missing.



4. Field Mapping Analysis:

For missing fields in the new DPAPI that were present in the old one:

Perform analysis to determine if alternative mappings are available.

Check across backend and UI for references.




5. Checklist for Unresolved Fields:

For any fields where mapping or purpose is unclear:

Add them to a checklist with context (e.g., expected usage, location, etc.).

Prepare these items for discussion in the next team/client call.
