71) R2: IBN Replacement - Consume DPAPI latest endpoints for IBN 2) OLB- Remove LivePerson Chat for SubUsers -> Benefit Remove potential risk with subusers and Live Person chat 3) OLB - Change OFX End Points to Transfers EAPIs. F Supports the shift to enterprise APls for modernization.
4) R2- Host AP| Update to Mulesoft y1.2 - Update to multiple endpoints -> Benefit: Enables a seamless conversion to Temenos 5) Card Hub Obfuscation v2. -> Benefit; Enhanced security within Card Hub -> Functionality: Digital must read/write obfuscated data for card hub V2 when passing between delivery systems 6) Change OFX End Points to Account Service EAPI. Benefit Supports the shift to enterprise APIs for modernization. 7) OLB - Change OFX End Points to Account Service EAPI. > Benefit: Supports the shift to enterprise APls for modernization. -> Functionality: OFX connections will move to EAPI 8) eManager Emulation - Enhance to include BillPay/Zelle/External Transfers > Benefit: Security via emulation is enhanced -> Functionality: Restrict the access to money movement via mulation to reduce the instance of fraud. With new exceptions. 9) IBN Replacement- Phase -> Benefit. IBN can be phased out -> Functionality: Add RCIF to headers and requests so that upstream and downstream partners can begin phasing out the use of IBN.

I want to send the above feature Details which we worked in our team. we need to highlight the above points need to show case to our management. plz analysis above details and give proper point which is impress to our management

Here’s a refined and management-friendly version of your team’s work. I’ve consolidated the features into clear themes (Security, Modernization, Risk Reduction, and Seamless Integration) and highlighted benefits in executive language.

### Key Accomplishments and Business Benefits

### Security Enhancements
- **Card Hub Obfuscation v2**  
  - Enforces obfuscation of card hub data across delivery systems.  
  - Provides stronger safeguards for sensitive customer information.  
  - Ensures end-to-end secure data handling in Digital channels.  

- **eManager Emulation Expansion (BillPay, Zelle, External Transfers)**  
  - Restricts direct access to money movement functions, reducing fraud risk.  
  - Improved protection through controlled emulation with defined exceptions.  

### Risk Reduction
- **OLB: Removal of LivePerson Chat for Sub-users**  
  - Eliminates potential exposure of sensitive customer data via sub-user sessions.  
  - Proactively reduces risk without impacting core servicing capabilities.  

### Modernization & API Transformation
- **Migration of OFX Endpoints to Enterprise APIs (EAPIs)**  
  - Transitions both Transfers and Account services to enterprise-ready APIs.  
  - Future-proofs integration by replacing legacy OFX connections.  
  - Enhances scalability, resiliency, and alignment with modernization roadmap.  

- **IBN Replacement Program**  
  - Transition to DPAPI latest endpoints for better compatibility and security.  
  - Introduced RCIF in headers to support phased decommissioning of IBN.  
  - Prepares the ecosystem for gradual IBN phase-out with minimal disruption.  

### Seamless Integration
- **R2 Host API Upgrade to Mulesoft y1.2**  
  - Consolidates multiple endpoints to streamline API connectivity.  
  - Lays foundation for smooth conversion to Temenos.  
  - Improves efficiency and reduces maintenance overhead.
