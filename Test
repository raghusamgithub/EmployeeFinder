Angular

Here's the feature breakdown in a concise, story-focused format, ready for a sprint backlog or high-level planning:
Feature: Address Change Block after Debit/NOW Card Order
Goal: Prevent fraudulent address changes for 24 hours after a new or replacement debit/NOW card is ordered, by blocking address modifications in OLB and displaying an informative message.
Business Value: Enhanced fraud prevention and increased customer security.
Stories & Estimates
 * Story 1: Implement 24-Hour Address Change Block (Points: 8)
   * Description: As a customer who recently ordered a debit/NOW card, I'm prevented from changing my address in OLB for 24 hours to prevent fraud, and I see a clear message.
   * Key Tasks (Highlights):
     * Integrate with Card Hub EAPI to get card requested date.
     * Develop backend logic to determine if a block is needed based on the 24-hour window.
     * Conditionally disable UI address fields.
 * Story 2: Display Informative Error Message (Points: 3)
   * Description: As a customer, when my address change is blocked, I see the approved "function not available" message so I understand why.
   * Key Tasks (Highlights):
     * Implement and style the error message UI component.
     * Ensure message is accessible and localized.
 * Story 3: Backend Card Order Validation Integration (Points: 5)
   * Description: As the OLB system, I reliably call the Card Hub EAPI to fetch card order dates, ensuring accurate address change blocking.
   * Key Tasks (Highlights):
     * Configure secure EAPI connectivity.
     * Develop a robust EAPI client/wrapper with error handling and logging.
Key Assumptions & Dependencies
 * Assumptions: Card Hub EAPI is stable and provides accurate, real-time card requested dates. The 24-hour block is a simple rolling window.
 * Dependencies:
   * XD/UX approval for error message content is crucial for UI finalization.
   * Card Hub EAPI must be fully operational and accessible. (Crucial clarification needed: Will DPAI validate and pass a flag, or will our team call getCards directly?)
This provides a quick overview for stakeholders while retaining the necessary detail for the development team to begin breaking down work.
